# FOOD-DELIVERY-TIME-PREDICTOR---NN Clustering
Food Delivery Time Predictor using Nueral Networks Clustering

This model was built on Kaggle Notebook since the code might not work on Jupyter Notebook due to version diferences or the use of Jupyter Web (which isnt the problem with Kaggle Notebook). The main source code utilises Machine Learning Algorithms specified to give the required output (included with the code itself).

**Original Kaggle Notebook Link:** https://www.kaggle.com/code/aayushmancodez/food-delivery-time-predictor-nncluster-v8

**To run the model:**

1) Open Kaggle.

2) Create a new Notebook.

3) Copy and paste the source code from this project into your new notebook.

4) Run the notebook to see the output.

**Model Summary**

Type of Model: Neural Networks Clustering

Objective: The goal of this model is to predict whether a food delivery will be "Fast" or "Delayed" based on features like customer location, restaurant location, weather, traffic conditions, and more. This dataset can be used to explore clustering and neural network models for predictive analytics.

Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
